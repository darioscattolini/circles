# Circles
> Define two circles and find out their relationships. 

## General info
This is the third JavaScript app I developed, also in October 2019. Users introduce data to build two circles, and the program displays information on the relationships between them and prints the circles on a canvas. It is my first approach to Object Oriented Programming and my first use of the canvas element. 

## Latest update
In December 2019, by then more familiar with best practices, I improved the code in order to include the project in my portfolio. The main changes where:
* Removed unnecesary README information from index.html, added a footer, and improved the responsive layout.
* Added README.md file.
* Added LICENCE.txt file.
* Made minor refactoring of JS code.
* Added more detailed and consistent comments in main.js.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS (using different combinations of nested grid and flex elements for a responsive layout)
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Canvas

## Status
_finished_

## Inspiration
This project is also a solution to an assignment I was given in the programming lessons I took during October and November at [Cibernárium](https://cibernarium.barcelonactiva.cat/) in Barcelona. It was one of the first Object Oriented Programming excercises we had to solve. The assignment asked to treat points and circles as objects built from classes defined in the style of Java. The different calculations performed are methods defined in the Circle class. I also implemented responsive typography for the first time. The challenging part: I added later a canvas element in order to provide a graphic representation of the circles.
